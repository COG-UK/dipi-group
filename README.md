DIPI is a working group within COG-UK. It aims to:

* Build a network of bioinformaticians who are developing software and pipelines that are core to the activities of the consortium.
* Connect this network to key users who submit data or conduct analysis.
* Provide a place to raise issues encountered during the running of software and pipelines and discuss potential implications and solutions.
* Agree, set and communicate standards for transferring data and messages between pipelines.
* Promote best practice for developing tools for use within the consortium, and releasing them as open source software to be used outside the remit of COG-UK.
* Discuss and plan for long-term running and maintenance of software and pipelines.
* Be responsible for communicating user-facing errors or changes that impact the consortium.
