* Pipeline updates
* Upcoming threats
* AOB

## Previous actions

No actions


## Special items

### New adm1

* Seems to have stalled with the COG-UK transition, SN is bumping the remainder of this work to the backlog.
  
### DAs to use CLIMB for sender_sample_id

* Complete from a DIPI perspective. TRC needs to push information to the Four Nations WG to encourage usage.

### Phylopipe2

* Datapipe and Phylopipe2 have been running smoothly

## Standing items

### Current development work

* AU identified a bug in Microreact affecting global trees which has been fixed.
* SN has been working on some glue things for PHE, will be looking at improving the performance of Asklepian by cutting down the amount of work that is done de novo next
* AT has been pushing civet3 forward and expects to get a beta ready soon (likely not this week)

### Pipeline updates

* SN happy to report no issues on Elan or Asklepian while on holiday!
* Discussion around moving the time of Elan have stalled due to change management processes

### Threats

* RP reports that we are entering critical territory for needing to reduce space on CLIMB-COVID
    * We'll likely need to erase the BAM backup for all sites (which is currently 60T)
    * Please survey your own directories/uploads/workflow caches for room we can restore!


### AOB

* The CLIMB COVID paper has been published in Genome Biology ðŸŽ‰
    * Huge thanks from SN to the group for all their contributions towards this monolithic work
    * Open access via https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02395-y
* Congrats to AU on the preprint of Phylocanvas https://osf.io/nfv6m/
* Congrats to AT and all the DIPI members on the Pangolin paper https://academic.oup.com/ve/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ve/veab064/6315289
