# Discussion

### Move the meeting

* **Meeting moved to 2021-01-08 (SN to set up)**

### Current development work

* SN deployed the performance improvements to Majora/Elan serializers discussed last week. Significant improvement observed in production.
* SN now developing scripts to push limited sequence information directly to public health agencies.
* MB has been working on improvements to the Cardiff environment as discussed last week.
* BJ has made changes to phylopipe, notably pulling out the B.1.177 subtree to improve performance.

### Last weekend's pipeline

* Encountered some turbulence in SLURM scheduling.
Nextflow was terminating completely when unable to submit a job, requiring the pipeline to be automatically re-raised repeatedly.
Unfortunately given the size of the pipeline, this would take some time to restart as the cache checking for Nextflow is very slow.
Not much could be done but SN altered the Elan configuration to submit fewer jobs and poll the SLURM server less often with some success.
Pipeline finished in time for automated GISAID submission and impending maintenance window.
We will continue to monitor systems but note Elan has run since daily since August 10th without trouble so do not believe this will be recurrent behaviour.

### Pipeline updates

* As discussed in last meeting, splitting the tree into large sublineages is less accurate but the only tractable solution available currently.
The B.1.177 subtree pulls out well and reduces execution time for phylopipe. Some Pangolin tweaking is needed.
* SN hoping to improve the post-Elan publishing script before the holidays to reduce the overhead of softlinking many files.

### Threats

* BJ reports that some of the Python scripts operating on the tree may exceed memory on the stack to deal with the level of recursion it needs. This will need some work in the near future.
* AU reports that syncing Pangolin web app to stable code is delayed since the links to microreact will break when phylopipe outputs different lineages to that currently within the pangoLEARN model. This will occur from time to time when phylopipe reveals issues that mean that pangoLEARN needs patching.

### AOB

* CLIMB hosted services will be best-effort between Friday 18th December and Monday 4th January.
* Happy holidays!
