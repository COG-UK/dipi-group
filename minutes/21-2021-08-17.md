## Special items

* RP will be moving the login node this week to newer hardware, hopefully combatting the cephfs dismount issue

## Standing items

### Current development work

* SN has been supervising our new recruit (SW) and building documentation
* SN has updated Ocarina across CLIMB-COVID to provide better error codes (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/125)

### Pipeline updates

* Everything generally chugging along
* A couple of Asklepian fails over the past two weeks but nothing we can't handle with the `raise` command
* Elan's publish step failed this week and required a token to be manually generated (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/126)

### Threats

* Keep clearing space where possible!

### AOB

* SN is stepping back from some of the more "public" channels (inbound/outbound distribution, metadata, account-requests and climb) to try and reduce the requests surface. SW will be keenly watching these channels and reporting issues to SN and RP where appropriate.
* RP will be away next week
