## Special items

Nothing special

## Standing items

### Current development work

* SN has launched "Foel", the second generation CLIMB-COVID ingest solution for private providers to much fanfare, but there is an issue with the first supplier

### Pipeline updates

* RC reports Datapipe has been running smoothly, save for a blip due to jobs being cancelled in advance of the SLURM maintenance
* RC reports users want big trees less often so has made some changes to Phylopipe which uncovered a delay in the publishing step due to `fastafunk add_columns`

### Threats

* The "million file directory" problem is reaching a tipping point and will need to be addressed soon

### AOB

* Closed #1: https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/1
