## Special items

* Happy new year DIPI!
* SN announces some career news and will be leaving the CLIMB-COVID project on March 11th...
    * SN promises a peaceful transfer of power to SW and TB
    * `nicholsz` user has been disabled on Majora and activities are undertaken by several new "service accounts"

## Standing items

### Current development work

Nothing special

### Pipeline updates

* Before Christmas we suddenly hit a breaking point with the file system causing absurdly large waiting times for building the daily artifacts
    * Inspired by their new coffee machine SN deployed the "caffeine cat" update which has reduced time to produce the daily artifacts from hours to minutes (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/154)
* We have hit the final straw on bad input sequences and have unilaterally decided to reject sequences with non-IUPAC bases from Elan after some egregious garbage made it through the pipeline
    * Additionally made worse by the response that ended up unpublishing all the data for the day... https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/179 
* Foel is now the standard ingest pipeline for private providers and its use has ramped up significantly since the New Year

### Threats

* The caffeine-cat update has bought us more time and stability but the big directories are going to need addressing as a priority now

### AOB

* All pipes flowed well over without much intervention over the holiday period -- amazing work!
