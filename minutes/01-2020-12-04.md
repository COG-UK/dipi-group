# Discussion

### Minutes and action management

* **Use github (SN to set up)**

### Current development work

* SN making performance improvements to Majora/Elan serializers
* BJ looking at additive tree building for phylopipe

### Phylopipe roadmap

* Tree building hard to scale - so many sequences. Takes time to do this from scratch.
* Splitting trees into large sublineages is less accurate but the only tractable solution currently. 
* BJ wants to focus on additive tree building but doesnâ€™t have the resources to maintain current instance of phylopipe and focus on new avenues for tree building simultaneously.
* Aso hard to test and visualise trees - pushing the boundaries of what can be done.
* **Stabilise phylopipe with testing environment at Cardiff (MB)**
* **Pull out any one-off work from phylopipe into a new pipeline (SN, BJ, MB, AU)**
* **In an alternative universe it would be interesting to investigate non-tree approaches.**

### Threats

* SN discussed performance improvements to Majora/Elan serializers that are necessary due to the linear relationship between serializer time and number of samples. Significant improvement gained by using the ORM more carefully to reduce the number of overall queries to the database. All Majora serializers now operate on seconds-to-minutes order for up to a million samples.
* No other immediate threats to report.

### AOB

* Finally a meeting we can enjoy. Decided to establish a fortnightly schedule.
