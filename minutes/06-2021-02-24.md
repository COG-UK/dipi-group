## Special items

### Phylopipe and datapipe

* RC reports two changes to the Pangolin lineage assignment software disrupted running of Phylopipe this week. A removed flag caused a command line option to be misinterpreted, and a new PANGO lineage alias was missing from the Phylopipe configuration. RC caught these issues and has been running a fixed version of Phylopipe manually.
    * Phylopipe will always have this dependency but RC suggests improved communication with the Pangolin developers could mitigate issues in future.
    * RC to suggest to Pangolin team that the PANGO aliases are kept in a machine-readable file in a public repository so that Phylopipe and others tools can download the most up to date copy.
* Two unscheduled reboots this week have led to a long waiting time for Phylopipe results as the longest running tree step was interrupted and had to start over.
    * SN reports that this is unusual behaviour for CLIMB-COVID but notes that uptime and stability should be improved when RP onlines the new login node.
* Datapipe is officially running and providing users with the MSA and metadata.
    * Users are happy as they no longer have to wait for phylopipe to complete successfully to obtain the MSA and metadata.
* Next task is porting the current Phylopipe steps to a new nextflow-based pipeline.
    * New phylopipe will likely stop building full trees and downsample by sequence diversity and/or sequencing date
    * RC will be working on new Phylopipe as main priority - ambitious schedule to get an initial implementation in two weeks

### Cardiff

* AS reports that work on the Cardiff development environment is complete. Kernels have been upgraded and last outstanding issues with cephfs seem to be resolved.
* AS has been working on file sync with Birmingham and will begin working on writing unit tests and documentation for Phylopipe


## Standing items

### Current development work

* RC has been working on a development version of Datapipe that features GISAID pre-processing and additionally working to improve the memory performance of some of the `fastafunk` steps.
* RC priority is to now work on Phylopipe 2.0 and development on Datapipe will likely stop until that is complete.
* SN has finalised the new ENA consensus submission pipeline and submitted a new sequence today. Awaiting feedback from the ENA team to check fields are correctly populated. A small batch of Birmingham sequences is ready for submission. Data working group needs to make a decision on what QC thresholds (if any) to apply to uploads.
* SN deployed a new step to Asklepian to build an sqlite database of the flat variants file. MB using this at PHW.
* SN investigated the difference between the "step 4" and "step 5" Phylopipe tree annotation steps and tracked this down to an inefficient tree reading implementation in `dendropy`. SN proposed a patch which has been accepted by `dendropy` upstream. RC has updated the version pin for Phylopipe and confirmed that the step 5 annotation time has been reduced (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/21). RC reports that the time reduction has allowed Phylopipe to fit into a schedule to catch a Tael message and run every 48 hours, rather than every 72 hours.
* SN has spent most of this week working to resolve the "stomping" problem (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/10). SN is pleased to report that Majora finally has some decent tests, which allow for changes to the add biosample API to be checked for regressions as part of the refactoring to allow for partial updates of samples in Majora. Work is going very well, but SN will wait to introduce this work properly next week when AU is present to discuss impacts on the uploader.


### Pipeline updates

* GISAID uploads were disrupted Monday, this was identified and resolved (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/27).
* As mentioned in our last meeting, additional nodes have been added to the SLURM pool which has improved throughput for Elan and other pipelines. Elan regularly processes 3500 to 5000 samples without trouble. No recent problems reported.

### Threats

* No new threats.

### AOB

* Metadata working group will be making some changes to fields, this will be discussed once their proposal has been finalised.
* A new Issues template has been added to the dipi-group repo to handle requests for new Majora validator options.
