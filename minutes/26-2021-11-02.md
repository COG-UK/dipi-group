## Special items

* TB has made their first patch to Majora -- https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/143
* RC reported file corruption after the recent kernel updates, after further investgation SN was able to reliably trigger the bug which led to discovery of [a recently reported regression in ceph](https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/51948)!
    * RP has rolled out updates to squash the corruption bug and sent SN pizza for the discovery
    * SN has run checks on Elan's published artifacts to confirm no corruption remains
    * RC confirms new Datapipe and Phylopipe artifacts are corruption-free

## Standing items

### Current development work

Nothing special

### Pipeline updates

* The non-IUPAC troubles are back https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/145
    * Datapipe is now rejecting all sequences from Elan which have non-IUPAC characters
* An update to datapipe minimap2 flags has improved the alignment where previously small sections of sequence were being replaced with Ns
* A new bug/milestone was reached in phylopipe where the maximum number of anonymous COG-IDs for microreact outputs had been set at 999999 which caused it to fail to complete. Since fixing, phylopipe has been producing smaller trees successfully but is taking a long time to catch up the time/large number of new sequences with the old big tree requested by users.
