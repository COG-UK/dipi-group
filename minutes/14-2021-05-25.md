## Proposed agenda

* Development roundup
* Pipeline updates
* Upcoming threats
* AOB

## Previous actions

Nothing to discuss


## Special items

### New adm1
* Some movement on contracts but nothing substantial

### ENA consensus submissions
* SN launched documentation to #metadata this week and has opened the floodgates to ENA.
* SN comments that this has been a huge amount of work covering teams at CLIMB, WSI, ENA and the INSDC.
* Additionally this work produced a re-usable pipeline for anyone who wants to make submissions to ENA/INSDC https://github.com/SamStudio8/elan-ena-nextflow, so hopefully it has been worth the wait...!

### PHW, PHS, PHNI will use CLIMB to check for orphan IDs from Sanger instead of sFTP
* New piece of substantial work, the four nations have agreed to use CLIMB-COVID and Majora to co-ordinate sharing of `sender_sample_id` rather than the clumsy sFTP route current employed
* SN suggests patching Majora's "blank" biosample routines to allow for empty samples to contain this linkage, and offer a secure dataview similar to the one PHE use now to share these IDs with the four nations
* See [https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/78](https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/78)

### Phylopipe 2
* RC back from well earned break and will be looking at some issues raised by AU
    * Last week's long branches are predicted to be lower quality sequences with ambiguities such that tree placement is difficult and they end up in weird places instead
    * A `pruned` tree will be written that only contains sequences with a unique placement back into the tree
    * There are a few duplicated COG IDs in the current datapipe output which stem from using phylopipe1 as input, this should disappear after the switchover

## Standing items

### Current development work

* SN has finished the "Warphog" project
    * Now works hilariously fast on the CPU and GPU
    * CPU improvements made by pre-compiling the most used function to C with Cython
    * Additional improvement from reading the file in parallel with multiple offset file handlers to overcome read speed on cephfs
    * SN comments that Warphog was mostly an experiment with CUDA (and Cython) born partly as `gofasta` appeared to have issues with scale, however `gofasta 0.0.4` has significantly improved
        * SN sends compliments to the gofasta chef
* SN has added some date fields to the secure PHE dataview to improve linkage (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/69)
* RC will be updating datapipe this week:
    * Several new metadata columns will be added
    * `pillar_2` will change to `is_pillar_2` to make it consistent with other bool columns in the output
        * SN notes that Pillar 103 should probably be marked as `is_pillar_2` in this output if it isn't already
    * Datapipe will use new Pangolin version so calls will change
* RC has written VOC/VUI definitions for Scorpio but has not tried them out yet
* VH has been working on mapping functionality for civet3 and has decided to take the plunge and write some geography cleaning scripts to handle `country` and `adm1` (but not `adm2` as "life is too short")
* AU reports that Microreact is ready to go on new phylopipe2 outputs once the remaining issues have been ironed out
* AU's team working on a pre-aggregated Microreact view to improve responsiveness for essential information
* AT reports that the civet3 wrapper is complete and adds lots of error handling
    * civet3 and new gofasta can now process 15 queries in 12 seconds, compared to 50 minutes (!)
* AT will merge Pangolin changes this week once documentation is complete
    * AU, RC and GISAID will be notified of the breaking changes when they are active
    * The panGUIlin flag will be deprecated
    * SN suggests any breaking changes should also be mentioned on to the DIPI changelog (with a link to more docs if needed)


### Pipeline updates

Nothing to report

### Threats

No new threats

### AOB

* Genome Biology have accepted the CLIMB-COVID paper for publication :tada:
* Mystery items have been distributed


## Action summary

No new actions to track
