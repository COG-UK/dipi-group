## Special items

Nothing special

## Standing items

### Current development work

* SN has been working on the new ingest solution, now has a proof of concept that wraps a proper queue around AWS SQS, read messages, pull relevant files to CLIMB and can parse/validate metadata
    * Need to handle pushing metadata to Majora which will require some changes to the experimental Ocarina API
* RC is now compressing the main public S3 outputs
* RC has been working on improving data quality and has detected cases where the `collection_date` appears after the `received_date` and raised them to #metadata
    * SN has now [patched this](https://github.com/SamStudio8/majora/commit/aba49d868633066e6c81787092f4d3722729b608) in Majora as it was not previously validated
    * SN reports that validating `sequencing_org_received_date` and `sequencing_submission_date` in a similar fashion is prohibitively difficult
    * SW has shared advice for using `ocarina put biosample --partial` to correct these dates

### Pipeline updates

* RC reports previous "big tree" job was interrupted by a reboot last week
    * RP reports that additional steps have been taken to prevent reboots and the situation is being monitored closely

### Threats

* Threat level on ENA BAM pipeline has increased, has required manual intervention each week for the past month to ensure it finishes by the weekend to avoid weekend cover
    * SN has ideas on improving performance but needs time to do some tests of a new version of dehumaniser
* SN has noticed the consensus writing step of Elan has suddenly become 2-3x slower
    * Will be investigating with RP

### AOB

* Reached *one million* sequences on 2021-09-17!
* SN has a new starter this week, will be taking them under the wing and hopes they can take over some of the Elan and Majora day-to-day, anticipate they'll be added to DIPI once up to speed
