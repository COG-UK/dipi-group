## Standing items

### Current development work

* SN has frozen all samstudio8 repos and forked them to the CLIMB-COVID github organisation
    * This will be particularly important to Ocarina users who must now install from https://github.com/climb-covid/ocarina2
* TB has set up a new test Majora instance and decommissioned the old one 
* AU has updated the metadata uploader to v100 that switches the test requests to use the new test Majora 
* SN has moved all the scripts and mqtt clients to use systemd services
  * TB and SW migrated all of these to a new climbcovid-services node yesterday
  * TB and SW can now start and stop these services
* SN completed work on sharding the BAM and FASTA directories, saving cephfs from disaster
* SN has [improved the performance of Asklepian](https://github.com/CLIMB-COVID/asklepian/commit/ab5faffd564512c357484122103a8d57a9471134) and the [PHE1 linkage dataview](https://github.com/CLIMB-COVID/majora2/commit/61255f246c2a95e59b040557d9068c68b041ff9b)

### Pipeline updates

* Elan has been migrated to Elan2 (a DSL2 version of elan-nextflow), and to a new execution node
  * SW is now taking care of the daily runs of Elan2
  * Experienced some teething issues with file permissions
  * We seem to have lost a bit of performance that SW will be taking a look at
* NE and NG are working towards UKHSA/PHE taking over Phylopipe
  * After initial teething issues we are hoping for a successful end to end run this week
* TW taking over development of Datapipe at Cardiff but will be overseeing the running at Birmingham going forward
* Microreact will stop outputting Phylopipe outputs

### Threats

* No threats

### AOB
