## Special items

* This is SN's last week at CLIMB-COVID
  * SN is locked out of Elan and Majora and plans to be locked out of all other CLIMB-COVID systems today
  * The 21 pipeline salute is scheduled for Friday.
* RC will be on leave after March 21st. Thanks for all your efforts on Phylopipe2 and downstream analysis!
* Welcome to our new DIPI members:
    * TW - Datapipe
    * NE - Phylopipe
    * NG - Phylopipe
    * SW - Elan
    * TB - Majora
* MQTT broker host has moved and will require a restart of any running mqtt-client

## Standing items

### Current development work

* SN has frozen all samstudio8 repos and forked them to the CLIMB-COVID github organisation
    * This will be particularly important to Ocarina users who must now install from https://github.com/climb-covid/ocarina2
* TB has set up a new test Majora instance and decommissioned the old one 
* AU has updated the metadata uploader to v100 that switches the test requests to use the new test Majora 
* SN has moved all the scripts and mqtt clients to use systemd services
  * TB and SW migrated all of these to a new climbcovid-services node yesterday
  * TB and SW can now start and stop these services
* SN completed work on sharding the BAM and FASTA directories, saving cephfs from disaster
* SN has [improved the performance of Asklepian](https://github.com/CLIMB-COVID/asklepian/commit/ab5faffd564512c357484122103a8d57a9471134) and the [PHE1 linkage dataview](https://github.com/CLIMB-COVID/majora2/commit/61255f246c2a95e59b040557d9068c68b041ff9b)

### Pipeline updates

* Elan has been migrated to Elan2 (a DSL2 version of elan-nextflow), to a new directory (/cephfs/covid/software/elan2), and to a new execution node
  * SW is now taking care of the daily runs of Elan2
  * Experienced some teething issues with file permissions
  * We seem to have lost a bit of performance that SW will be taking a look at
* NE and NG are working towards UKHSA/PHE taking over Phylopipe
  * After initial teething issues we are hoping for a successful end to end run this week
* TW taking over development of Datapipe at Cardiff but will be overseeing the running at Birmingham going forward
* Microreact will stop outputting Phylopipe outputs
* Clean versions of phylopipe scripts and runs have moved to /cephfs/covid/software/phylopipe and in line with this, a final step of the datapipe bash script now rsyncs the master files from datapipe run directory to a subdirectory of this phylopipe location
* TW will have read/write permissions to /cephfs/covid/bham/raccoon-dog initially, but this will probably be decomissioned as the run location for all datapipe/phylopipe once Cardiff's version is running
* Larger disk attached to Majora to hold temporary celery task results to mitigate future out of space issues on multiple Elan/dataview restarts

### Threats

* No threats

### AOB

* No other business
