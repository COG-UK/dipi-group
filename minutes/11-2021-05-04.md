## Previous actions

* Nothing to discuss

## Special items

### Ion Torrent incident

As discussed in the channel on April 16th 2021, SN added `ION_TORRENT` to the `instrument_make` validator which led to a data integrity incident (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/55).
RC raised the alarm after encountering sequences in phylopipe1 with an implausibly high number of Ns for a basic QC PASS.
This was resolved swifly with almost no impact to downstream analysis.
Additionally, the ENA BAM submission pipeline also fell over (without impact) due to the addition of this platform.

The issues were tracked together under DIPI#58 (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/58) and future mitigations are:

* Majora cannot create a QC report without applying at least one QC rule
* DIPI group repository has a special Issue type to add a sequencing platform to ensure that all steps that are affected by the `instrument_make` to be considered

As it affected the downstream data, the incident was also written up by SN (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/blob/official/postmortems/20210416_iontorrentqc.md).


### Connectivity issues

The network issues at Birmingham on April 16th, and intermittently through the week of April 19th appear to have been resolved.
The issue was beyond the control of CLIMB and affected all university services.

Two issues caused by the outage were of note:

* Another edge case in Majora where an object that should only exist once was created in close succession to another. SN will monitor for further issues.
* Network disruption caused the pre-Elan metadata fetch to fail, resulting in an emtpy table on April 21st (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/60)

## Standing items

### Current development work

* RC updated Datapipe, Phylopipe1 and Phylopipe2 to handle the additional adm1. RC reports from VH that the geography cleaning steps can handle these adm1.
* RC has been working on Constellation typing in Datapipe
* RC provided AU with a beta output from Phylopipe2 to check its integrity
* RC has been extending Phylopipe2 to do Pangolin training, using the USHER sequence tree placement to try and improve accuracy of calls
* SN has updated the `mqtt-client` to automatically join a client to a topic about itself, allowing for messages to be passed directly to clients for manually raising pipelines
* SN has made some minor changes to Majora and Ocarina to better support automation of some v2 API interfaces for PHA

### Pipeline updates

* Elan failed on April 21st (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/60) due to a network connectivity error, and also due to a `grep` searching for failed files to exit 1; knocking the pipeline over (failed due to lack of fails!) and April 27th (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/65) due to an unknown error.
* RC reported `sbatch` errors on April 28th and tracked down an issue with using exponential backoff and retry with MB. RC reports the pipeline seems to be more stable now.

### Threats

* The nightly accessions table could not be generated due to a resource limit. RP has raised this limit. SN will monitor the situation but notes this is another scaling issue in Majora that should be addressed eventually (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/56).
* Available space has been rapidly reducing recently, RP asks users to check their usage and delete any unnecessary intermediate or testing files.

### AOB

* SN has submitted the CLIMB-COVID paper to Genome Biology :tada:
* SN has closed and moved a set of "nice to have" tasks to a "Backlog task" to try and keep the DIPI issues organised https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/62
* SN has had good feedback about issues being raised for downed pipelines
* SN has set up a changelog to try and consolidate information on notable changes to software and data interchange formats across DIPI controlled pipelines and services.
    * The log is hosted via Github pages https://data.covid19.climb.ac.uk/changelog
    * SN encourages anyone in DIPI to send pull requests to detail anything that may be important for other DIPI members or downstream analysts to know
