## Special items

* Last week's scheduled downtime lasted longer than expected but VMs and jobs continued uninterrupted as expected.
* This is MB's last week with us, thanks for all the Nextflow help!

## Standing items

### Current development work

* The change to Asklepian was finally approved and it is VERY fast (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/117)
  * Thanks again to BJ for gofasta
* SN has finally fixed the OAuth token refresh race condition (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/114)
* AT reports civet3 beta release is progressing well and now supports the latest datapipe output format
  * Plenty of advancements to come but most bugs seem to have been squashed

### Pipeline updates

* RC reports datapipe and phylopipe have been running and are reboot-robust now (thanks to SN helping with cron tasks)
* Elan 20210802 failed due to an S3 problem, Majora's celery task backend was moved on the fly to enable Elan to run (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/115)

### Threats

* SN has released a bunch of space (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/101) but if anyone can release more, please continue to do so!

### AOB

* AT is going "off grid" for thesis-finishing, best of luck from DIPI!
