## Special items

Nothing special

## Standing items

### Current development work

* SN has been working on the new ingest solution

### Pipeline updates

* RC reports Datapipe and Phylopipe have been running smoothly since recent updates
* RC building large trees but had to find a new outgroup for Delta to make it manageable again, the only choice of sequence was initially being filtered so small minor work to Phylopipe is required

### Threats

No new threats

### AOB

* We'll hit one million sequences this week!
* Congrats to RC on their new paper! ðŸŽ‰
