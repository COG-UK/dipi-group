## Special items

### Phylopipe

* Congratulations to RC for wrangling phylopipe back into schedule. RC reports reliable running every two (sometimes three) days.
* Post-phylopipe publishing step now uploading to public S3 bucket, currently not generating the automated reports.
* RC is using the previous `Pangolin` release until stability is confirmed.
* RC reports tree rooting and post-tree annotation steps take some time.
    * RP provided a SLURM history for phylopipe jobs
    * SN wrote a script to calculate average run time of each step to focus efforts
    * SN highlighted an interesting difference between the `step_4_annotate_tree` and `step_5_annotate_tree` and will investigate why the latter takes so much longer.
    
## Standing items

### Current development work

* SN has been working to improve the performance of the post-Elan publishing step (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/20) and the Asklepian data export to Public Health England (https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/17).
These gains were obtained by reducing queries to the filesystem which can sometimes be inefficient depending on system-wide load on the file metadata servers.
The publishing pipeline is around 90-120 minutes faster, and Asklepian completes 120 minutes faster too.
* SN has written a Nextflow pipeline for sequence submissions to ENA (https://github.com/SamStudio8/elan-ena-nextflow).
Everything is in place to test automated submissions with a subset of Birmingham sequences.
Currently waiting for a discussion at the COG Data Working Group to decide what information should be added to the `DESCRIPTION` field to point toward a COG operated data source for QC flags.
* SN has deployed new documentation for Majora and Ocarina (https://samstudio8.github.io/majora-docs/).
This documentation should be easier to maintain as it is primarily generated from Majora's OpenAPI YAML file.
This is now the *de facto* source for Majora and Ocarina examples and also tries to highlight important differences between Ocarina/API uploads and the CGPS uploader.
* AU reported last week that the Pangolin web application on CLIMB has a lot of sequences in its queue and requested more cores.
This request could not be granted by RP as cores are limited until new hardware comes online.
After some profiling AU discovered the delay was primarily down to loading the Pangolin model.
AU and team have worked to re-engineer the application and improved performance by 5x, clearing the queue.
* RC has developed a new Nextflow based pipeline (currently called `datapipe`) which handles pre-tree activities such as building the MSA alignments and metadata munging.
It is anticipated that `datapipe` will run after Elan and ensure that most commonly used artifacts will be available to users every day, decoupling these steps from the longer (and occasionally problematic) tree building.
RC reports that parallel testing of `datapipe` has been successful and is ready to be deployed.
    * SN suggested that `datapipe` should have a cool name but offered no suggestions

### Pipeline updates

* Additional nodes have increased performance of Elan and other pipelines. The ENA BAM pipeline is also working reliably.

### Threats

* As mentioned in our last meeting, SN had noticed that some `find` steps were particularly slow and this can sometimes delay pre-Elan file gathering steps.
SN and RP have looked briefly into resolving this.
A cephfs utility tool appeared promising but is not appropriately packaged. Investigation will continue.

### AOB

* No other business.
