## Proposed agenda

* Development roundup
* Pipeline updates
* Upcoming threats
* AOB

## Special items

* The SLURM scheduler and compute nodes will be down for upgrades next Thursday 8th AM to Friday 9th PM (2 working day downtime). Login and Majora to run as normal.

## Standing items

### Current development work

* SN has been working on a small API to issue COG identifiers. Currently it can respond to example requests for new identifiers but SN wants to deploy authentication and potentially use OAuth. See more at the repo: https://github.com/SamStudio8/zana and issue https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/40.
* SN has been working on a request to add more fields to the Asklepian data tables for PHE. See https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/37.
* SN has patched Majora to prevent special characters appearing in the sample name after a single sample caused some brief trouble with file resolving in Nextflow.
* SN reports the final touches on the ENA consensus submission pipeline are now in place and a test submission has been sent to ENA.

### Pipeline updates

* The `samtools sort` step during Elan has been removed to increase throughput. The majority of sites use the stable ARTIC pipelines or similar derivatives where the BAM is correctly sorted before upload. It is a waste of compute resources and (perhaps more importantly) time to re-sort these BAMs on the Elan ingest. The `samtools index` step is now also a "quickcheck" step which will drop out samples that cannot be indexed (as they are unsorted). These will be reported back to sites using the quickcheck summary posted to #inbound-distribution each day. See https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/39.
* Elan has been deployed to a temporary node to ensure continuity during next week's scheduled downtime. This was tested today and is working exceptionally well. SN and RP have benchmarked it as a 50% performance improvement compared to running it on SLURM.
* RC reports there are over 150,000 samples in the B.1.1.7 tree. Sublineages of B.1.1.7 have not yet been agreed, requiring this tree to be built as-is. RC has increased the time request to 48 hours and reduced the tree to include samples from the last 5 months to attempt to control its size.
    * MB had some sequences disappear which has been explained by the change in tree scope
* On Phylopipe2, RC reports that although `veryfasttree` was indeed very fast, it appears to require at least 3x more RAM than its `fasttree` predecessor, making it an unreasonable alternative for phylopipe 2.0.
    * Reverted to using `fasttree` with sparser background and only the previous 100 days of samples, using USHER to add back in remaining sequences. USHER sequences are added back in a chunked fashion to improve performance. Difficult to get working in Nextflow.
    * USHER sometimes segfaults at the end of its processing, still debugging.
    * Some trouble with passing environment variables through the MQTT handler. SN to take a look after the Easter break.
    * Phylopipe2 largely works but still work to be done in checking for correctness.
* A recent "Pangothon" involved full curation of the PANGO lineages. RC's downsampling script has been leveraged to help train Pangolin and now the training time has been reduced from days to hours.
* RC reports a few small delays to Datapipe this week as a result of trying to output a new file. This has been solved.

### Threats

* Downstream analysts have noticed the `-` deletion character is included in the uploaded consensus by some sites. This is unintentionally supported. There is an open question at the data working group on how to handle these sequences going forward. SN and RC have added `-` handling code where necessary to Asklepian and Datapipe respectively. See https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/38.
* Large API responses on some Majora endpoints (used by Elan and other internal pipelines) have broken a maximum temporary file size limit. This has been temporarily mitigated with a configuration change but SN needs to investigate alternatives for sending large payloads to Ocarina clients in future. See https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/34.
* If Monday's ENA BAM outbound pipeline is slow or delayed, it can interfere with Elan. SN needs to balance the resources for the dehumanisation pipeline. See https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/42.

### AOB

* SN has been asked to look at how to enable access to QC failed sequences as PHE want to investigate the viability of variant calling despite their QC status. See https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/45.
* SN is off next week (but will be watching the pipelines as always) but hopes everyone has a nice Easter weekend and manages to find some time away from the pipelines.
