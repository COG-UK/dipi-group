## Special items

### New adm1

* No update

### DAs to use CLIMB for sender_sample_id

* Good progress. Basic system working, WSI is able to upload blanked samples with linkage. Linkage can be viewed by users with access to new DA1 dataview that offers secure access to sample linkage where adm1 is unset.
* Working with WSI on outstanding issues, notably around how WSI can get this to work. Their workflow has been using the legacy "force biosamples" behaviour from the library endpoint.
* SN expect to have this resolved and deployed by the end of the week.

### Phylopipe2

* RC has made some tweaks to improve outputs (including pruning the long branches mentioned last week)
* Outputs updated to match Phylopipe1 outputs to ensure interoperability with civet
* Phylopipe2 is now publishing to `latest`, no errors reported downstream
* Next, RC will be working on S3 publishing and a process to generate and update the "big" tree on a weekly basis

## Standing items

### Current development work

* SN has been working on Asklepian to improve the service offered to PHE
* As a small side project, SN has been trying the "Rich" Python library (https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) to make a command line dashboard that can read and display CLIMB-COVID status information read from the Tael mqtt messages (https://twitter.com/samstudio8/status/1401944335478837248)
* RC has been working on the input trees and protobuf definitions to improve Pangolin's USHER mode
* VH asked SN whether the issue regarding old samples not being updatable has been resolved, SN reported the issue has been closed and the site in question has made the updates needed. VH can now work on their phylogeograpy analysis.

### Pipeline updates

* Elan 20210602 failed due to a corrupted BAM (which passed samtools quickcheck) https://github.com/COG-UK/dipi-group/issues/82
    * Investigation with data supplier showed that the BAM was generated on a machine that had run out of tmp space and did not log an error
    * SN has updated Elan to cat the BAM to /dev/null to catch these errors but this is likely overkill and will be reverted


### Threats

* Sample numbers seem to be increasing again, threatening our scale
* A site pushed a series of identifiers which were polluted with run-related information, SN working with the source to prevent this from happening again and to remove the existing IDs from the dataset


### AOB

* No other business
